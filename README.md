# C++ assignments for my school
(If this text is in Polish or any other language than English please turn off automatic translation. I don't recommend that)

Here I store all C++ assignments issued by my teacher.  
I use the `DD.MM.YYYY` date format. Function names, variables, comments etc. are in English, but everything printed on the console is written in Polish (except bash scripts). I can translate if you need to.

**Please do not just copy and paste my code if you want to use it for school**. I've decided to make it open source only to help people learn off examples.  
(I hope my teacher won't accuse me of stealing my own code if he finds this lol)
